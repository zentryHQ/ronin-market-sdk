# Ronin Market SDK

The Ronin Market SDK is the underlying package that [mavis-market-core](https://github.com/skymavis/mavis-market-sdk/blob/main/packages/core) (Typescript) uses behind the scenes to execute core functionality (listing, bidding, buying and selling).

The [mavis-market-core](https://github.com/skymavis/mavis-market-sdk/blob/main/packages/core) can be used if you are using another JavaScript framework.
